Before these parts do their work, their input undergoes layer normalisation, and residual connections are added to help the model learn more effectively. The input to the architecture is a sequence of token IDs; these are turned into embeddings and augmented with information about the absolute position of each token in the sequence. The output layer converts the internal representations into logit scores for every token in the vocabulary."

Unlike simpler benchmarks, HellaSwag presents scenarios where the correct text completion depends on semantic relationships between events and on world knowledge.
