However, there are two points in the GPT architecture where variance can grow uncontrollably: the residual connections after the multi-head attention and the MLP. Since these connections simply add activations from previous layers, their variances increases with depth. To see this, note that if we sum $N$ independent normally distributed variables with variance $\\sigma^2$, the result has variance $N \\sigma^2$. The factor $1/\\sqrt{N}$ compensates for this growth."

    "One of the optimisations we can make when training large language models is choosing an appropriate floating-point representation. A floating-point number is represented using three components: a **sign bit**, an **exponent**, and a **fraction** (also called mantissa). The number of bits assigned to the exponent determines the *range* of the representation, while the number of bits in the fraction determines the *precision*.\n",

    "The most commonly used floating-point format is single-precision floating point (fp32), which uses 1&nbsp;sign bit, 8&nbsp;exponent bits, and 23&nbsp;fraction bits. However, most deep learning computations do not require the full 23-bit precision of fp32. As a result, modern hardware supports lower-precision formats that improve performance and memory efficiency while maintaining training stability. We are particularly interested in two of those:\n",
    "\n",
    "**TensorFloat-32 (tf32)** is a precision format introduced by NVIDIA. It keeps the same 8-bit exponent as fp32, preserving the same numerical range. However, tf32 reduces the fraction size to 10 bits, leading to lower precision but faster matrix multiplications on dedicated GPUs.\n",

    "**Brain Floating Point 16 (bf16)** is another reduced precision format widely used in NVIDIA GPUs. Like tf32, bf16 has the same 8-bit exponent as fp32, and therefore, the same range. However, bf16 has only 7 bits for the fraction. Unlike tf32, which is primarily used for internal computations, bf16 can be directly stored and used for activations, weights, and gradients, which can save memory (16 bits per value instead of 32)."
