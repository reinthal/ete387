Recall that an input to this model takes the form of a vector of $n-1$ integer ids representing preceding words. We will refer to this vector as the *context window* and to its length as the *window size*. Each word id is mapped to a vector via an embedding layer. (All positions share the same embedding.) The embedding vectors are then concatenated and sent through a two-layer feed-forward network with a non-linearity in the form of a rectified linear unit (ReLU). The output of that network can be interpreted as a categorical probability distribution over all possible words."

    "The training loop for the recurrent neural network model is essentially identical to the loop that you wrote for the feed-forward model. The only thing to note is that the cross-entropy loss function expects its input to be a two-dimensional tensor; you will therefore have to re-shape the output tensor from the LSTM as well as the gold-standard output tensor in a suitable way. The most efficient way to do so is to use the [`view()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html#torch.Tensor.view) method."

In PyTorch, the weights of the embedding layer are initialised by sampling from the standard normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$. How do different initialisations affect the perplexity of your fixed-window language model?\n",

Two standard articles in this area are [Glorot and Bengio (2010)](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/glorot10a.html) and [He et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2015.123), whose initialisation strategies have been implemented in the [`nn.init`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.init.html) module.
